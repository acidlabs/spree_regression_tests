Spree Regression Tests
======================

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/acidlabs/spree_regression_tests.png)](https://travis-ci.org/acidlabs/spree_regression_tests)

This extension aims at providing us all, Spree developers, a set of regression tests which we can include in our Spree projects so we never break any vanilla Spree feature unintentionally.
